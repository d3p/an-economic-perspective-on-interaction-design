# an economic perspective on interaction design

an economic perspective on interaction design or how to earn money as a designer. if you find anything missing or wrong in this list of models, please send additions or corrections to d.paul@hfk-bremen.de

this document aims to present economic models for earning money as a designer. some models assume that design is practiced as intended by the discipline ( e.g working for clients, selling works ), while others rather aim to apply design skills in other areas ( e.g becoming a star on youtube ). although most models are applicable to all fields of design ( e.g fashion, product, graphic design ) and some even to art practice, the main focus is on interaction design ( especially the research section ).

one of the reasons for compiling this document is to question if the designer-client relationship is to be taken for granted as the most feasable or dominant model.
